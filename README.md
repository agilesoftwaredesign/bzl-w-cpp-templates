This repository plays with

* [bazel package visibilty](https://bazel.build/concepts/visibility) to support architecural guidance during local build (e.g., [hexagonal architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)) or clean architecure).
* make use of C++ template pre-instantiation to save build time and force well-organized implementation of templates.
